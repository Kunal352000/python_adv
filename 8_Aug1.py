Multitasking:
============
    The concept of doing/executing multiple tasks parallely/concurrently/same time
    is known as a multitasking
        ex:-class room student
    the multi-tasking can be categorized into two types,they are
        1) Process based multitasking
            ex: multi-processsing
        2) thread based multi-tasking
            ex: multi-threading
1) process based multi-tasking:-
--------------------------------
    The concept of doing/executing multiple process/application at same time/paraelly
    concurrently is known as a process based multi-tasking

    or

    The concept of doing or executing multiple or several independent application
    running parelley is known as process based multitasking
        ex:listening the songs(VLC media player)-->idle python

2) thread based multi-tasking:-
--------------------------------
    The concept of doing or executing multiple or severral independent subparts in a same
    application/program parallely is known as a thread based multi-tasking.
        ex:downloading movie by using utorrent

-->What is thread?
===================
    a thread is light weight process,which is used to represent the business logic to perform
    a single action.

What is multi-threading?
========================
The concept of doing/executing multiple/several threads parallely is known as a multi-threading
python supporting multi-threading concept
we can implement the multi-threading concepts in python by using threading module
in python,every program act as one thread by default that thread is called main-thread.

how to create a thread?
=======================
we can define any logic as a thread by overriding run() of thread class of threading module."""
